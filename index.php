They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making available affordable agricultural credit or crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the Nation.</b></p>
